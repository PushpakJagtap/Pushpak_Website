The Extreme-ANFIS implements a novel neuro-fuzzy learning mechanism develop by us to accelerate and extent the applicability of conventional ANFIS (which is only useful for regression of single-input single-output). The algorithm is useful in many applications such as regression, MIMO modelling, and Multi-class classification.
