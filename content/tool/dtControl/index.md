The dtControl provides the memory-efficient, compact, understandable representation and the efficient determinization for the formal symbolic controllers obtained from the state-of-the-art toolboxes SCOTS and UPPAL. It also provides a scheme to design non-uniform quantizers (i.e., state encoders with non-uniform partitioning of state-set) for symbolic controllers. The results are also useful for constructing efficient static coders minimizing bit rate over the sensor-controller channel.
