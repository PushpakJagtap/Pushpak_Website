# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "QUEST is an open source software tool, developed in C++, for automated controller synthesis for incrementally input-to-state stable nonlinear control systems. The tool contains two major parts:
1. **Construction of symbolic abstraction:** the tool uses state-space quantization-free approach for the construction of symbolic abstraction which can be potentially more beneficial for systems with high-dimensional state spaces.
2. **Symbolic controller synthesis:** the synthesis of controller using fixed point computations, namely, maximal and maximal fixed points, thus natively supports safety and reachability specifications . The tool is intended to be used and extended by researches in the area of formal synthesis for complex systems. "
