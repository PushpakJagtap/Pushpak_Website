There is a large semantic gap between control algorithms - making idealistic assumptions on the implementation platform (e.g., fault-tolerence architecture, memory requirement, data-rate requirements etc.) - and their actual implementation on concrete platforms. In this research area we focus on providing controller code enforcing rich specifications while taking into account the features of the computational platforms.

## Highlights of the proposed results include:
