# Abstract and optional shortened version.
# abstract = "Synthesis of controllers for stochastic control systems ensuring safety constraints has gained considerable attention in the last few years. In this paper, we consider the problem of synthesizing controllers for partially observed stochastic control systems to ensure finite-time safety. Given an estimator with a probabilistic guarantee on the accuracy of the estimations, we provide an approach to compute a controller providing a lower bound on the probability that the trajectories of the stochastic control system remain safe over a finite time-horizon. To obtain such controllers, we utilize a notion of control barrier functions. We also provide an approac to compute a probability bound on estimator accuracy by using a notion of so-called stochastic simulation function. The proposed result is illustrated on a case study."
