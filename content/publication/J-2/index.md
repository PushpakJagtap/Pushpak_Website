# Abstract and optional shortened version.
# abstract = "This paper, proposes a complex Laplacian-based distributed control scheme for convergence in the multi-agent network. The proposed scheme has been designated as cascade formulation. The proposed technique exploits the traditional method of organizing large scattered networks into smaller interconnected clusters to optimize information flow within the network. The complex Laplacian-based approach results in a hierarchical structure, with the formation of a meta-cluster leading other clusters in the network. The proposed formulation enables flexibility to constrain the eigenspectra of the overall closed-loop dynamics, ensuring desired convergence rate and control input intensity. The sufficient conditions ensuring globally stable formation for the proposed formulation are also asserted. Robustness of the proposed formulation to uncertainties like loss in communication links and actuator failure have also been discussed. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated by simulating a finitely large network of 30 vehicles."
