# Abstract and optional shortened version.
# abstract = "The paper considers the problem of motion synchronization in multi-agent systems while maintaining a specific inter-agent formation pattern. The agents are modelled as double integrator dynamical systems with motion reference generated by a virtual leader referred to as exosystem. The main essence of this paper lies in integration of output regulation techniques with complex Laplacian based consensus algorithm to synchronize motion of the multi-agent system. The stability properties of designed controller for overall dynamics of multi-agent network are discussed. Simulation results are also presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control law."
