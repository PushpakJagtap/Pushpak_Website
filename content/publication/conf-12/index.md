# Abstract and optional shortened version.
# abstract = "In this paper, we provide a compositional framework for synthesizing hybrid controllers for interconnected discrete-time control systems enforcing specifications expressed by co-Buchi automata. In particular, we first decompose the given specification to simpler reachability tasks based on automata representing the complements of original co-Buchi automata. Then, we provide a systematic approach to solve those simpler reachability tasks by computing corresponding control barrier functions. We show that such control barrier functions can be constructed compositionally by assuming some small-gain type conditions and composing so-called local control barrier functions computed for subsystems. We provide two systematic techniques to search for local control barrier functions for subsystems based on the sum-of-squares optimization program and counter-example guided inductive synthesis approach. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of our results through two large-scale case studies."
