# Abstract and optional shortened version.
# abstract = "This paper proposes a new neuro-fuzzy learning machine called extreme learning adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ELANFIS) which can be applied to control of nonlinear systems. The new learning machine combines the learning capabilities of neural networks and the explicit knowledge of the fuzzy systems as in the case of conventional adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The parameters of the fuzzy layer of ELANFIS are not tuned to achieve faster learning speed without sacrificing the generalization capability. The proposed learning machine is used for inverse control and model predictive control of nonlinear systems. Simulation results show improved performance with very less computation time which is much essential for real time control."
