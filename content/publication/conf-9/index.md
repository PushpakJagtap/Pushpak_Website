# Abstract and optional shortened version.
# abstract = "Abstraction-based synthesis techniques are limited to systems with moderate size. Thus to contribute towards scalability of these techniques, in this paper we propose a compositional abstraction-based synthesis for cascade interconnected discrete-time control systems. Given a cascade interconnection of several components, we provide results on the compositional construction of finite abstractions based on the notion of approximate cascade composition. Then, we provide a compositional controller synthesis for cascade interconnection. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the results using a numerical example and compare it with different abstraction and controller synthesis schemes."
