# Abstract and optional shortened version.
# abstract = "In this paper, we introduce QUEST, a new tool for automated controller synthesis of incrementally input-to-state stable nonlinear control systems. This tool accepts ordinary differential equations as the descriptions of the nonlinear control systems and constructs their symbolic models using state-space quantization-free approach which can potentially alleviate the issue of so-called curse of dimensionality while computing discrete abstractions of the systems with high-dimensional state-space. The tool supports computation of both minimal and maximal fixed points and thus provides natively algorithms to synthesize controllers enforcing safety and reachability specifications. All the computations are done in C++. Finally, we illustrate the performance of the tool on a 10-room building temperature control."
