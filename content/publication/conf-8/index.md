# Abstract and optional shortened version.
# abstract = "Incremental stability is a strong property of dynamical systems ensuring the uniform asymptotic stability of each trajectory rather than a fixed equilibrium point or fixed trajectory. Here, we introduce a notion of incremental stability for time-delayed stochastic control systems and provide a sufficient condition under which the time-delayed stochastic control systems are incrementally stable. We show the effectiveness of the proposed result on a numerical example."
